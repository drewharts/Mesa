# MESA
Save, organize, and share places with friends. A friend's recomendation is more valuable than any stranger.
## Dream Big
Dream big, really big. Even if you only achieve half, you will acheive more than your competition. Don't die with a whimper, always push bigger and higher. Don't be afriad of a failing, just try.
## Mesa's Big Dream
We believe a friend's recomendation is much more valuable than any random review on the internet. Mesa is Google Maps for just your friends. See all your friends and JUST your friends favorite places anywhere in the world.
